## About Me

I'm an Electrical Engineering student at UPB (Universitatea Politehnica București) specialising in **Electric Drives and Power Electronics**. I build embedded systems and hardware from the ground up — from schematic design and PCB layout to firmware, testing and documentation.

My projects span automotive electronics, industrial automation and robotics. I work at the intersection of hardware and software, with a growing focus on integrating **local AI inference** into embedded systems for predictive control and intelligent automation.

I've presented projects at **European Researchers' Night** (Noaptea Cercetătorilor) and been published in a student technical journal. I'm currently developing a commercial-grade greenhouse automation controller as a standalone product.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🌿 [Greenhouse Automation System](https://github.com/leogamerxxl/greenhouse-automation)
> **Research & PCB Design Phase**

Industrial-grade precision agriculture controller for a **0.7ha greenhouse** — designed as a standalone commercial product. Single enclosure, plug-and-play deployment.

- **Control core:** Portenta H7 / Arduino Giga R1 + Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB)
- **AI layer:** Gemma 4 running locally — predictive control, anomaly detection, crop recommendations
- **Sensor bus:** RS-485 / Modbus RTU — temperature, humidity, light, anemometer per zone
- **Actuation:** 4× AC motor (reversible via relay) for side panels, irrigation, ventilation per zone
- **Telemetry:** LoRa 868MHz field → ESP32 WiFi gateway → mobile app
- **HMI:** Waveshare 10" AMOLED touch — industrial SCADA-style UI, fully autonomous offline
- **PCB:** Custom board — aluminium anodised enclosure, IP65, integrated LoRa antenna, M12 connectors

### 🚗 [Steering Wheel Adapter — Renault Clio 5 → Dacia Logan I](https://github.com/leogamerxxl/steering-wheel-adapter)
> **Ongoing**

Wireless gateway between OEM Clio 5 steering wheel controls and an aftermarket infotainment unit on a Logan I. Solved a real automotive integration problem with zero infrastructure dependency.

- **Architecture:** Two ESP32 WROOM boards communicating via **ESP-NOW** (peer-to-peer, no router)
- **Latency:** ~1ms button response — imperceptible to the driver
- **Wiring:** Direct GPIO connections to physical steering wheel buttons — no LIN bus required
- **Power:** 12V automotive → 3.3V regulated per board

### 🤖 [Wall Crawler — Vertical Surface Robot](https://github.com/leogamerxxl/wall-crawler)
> **v1 Prototype · v2 In Design**

Robot with active adhesion for vertical surfaces. v1 presented at **European Researchers' Night** and published in student journal **Sirius**.

**v2 improvements (in design):**
- Brushless motor + CFD-optimised duct — calculated ΔP ≥ 1.8 kPa (68% above minimum)
- Closed-loop pressure control via BMP280 + PID
- IMU tilt detection (MPU-6050) — adaptive suction setpoint per surface angle
- TB6612FNG motor driver — 95% efficiency vs 70% (L298N)
- INA219 current monitoring per rail — overcurrent protection
- Non-blocking firmware — millis()-based task scheduler, zero delay()

### 🚙 [Bluetooth Mini Tank — v1]([https://github.com/leogamerxxl/tank-bt](https://github.com/leogamerxxl/Mini-Tank-Bluetooth-Controlled-with-Turret))
> **v1 Completed · v2 In Design**

Tracked vehicle with 4 DC motors, 2-axis servo turret (360° pan + 90° tilt), controlled via Android app using ASCII commands over Bluetooth.

- **Steering:** Differential PWM — smooth arcs, not jerky pivots
- **Turret:** Pan servo (continuous 360°) + tilt servo (90°) — mapped to app buttons
- **Driver:** L293D dual H-bridge — 4 channels, motors wired in parallel pairs
- **Control app:** Bluetooth RC Car (Android) — full ASCII command map documented

### ➡️ [Line Follower PID — v1](https://github.com/leogamerxxl/line-follower-pid)
> **v1 Completed · v2 In Design**

High-speed line follower with PID control on Arduino Nano. 5-sensor TCRT5000 array with weighted position error and automatic calibration at startup.

- **Algorithm:** Weighted average across 5 sensors → PID error → differential motor speed
- **Calibration:** 3-second auto-calibration on boot — normalises per ambient light conditions
- **Anti-windup:** Integral clamped ±50 — prevents overshoot on straight sections
- **Line-lost recovery:** Last known error × 1.5 — robot recovers instead of stopping
